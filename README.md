# Vishal Chauhan — Personal Website

This is a simple static website template for Human–Machine Interaction researcher Vishal Chauhan.

Files included
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — small JS for mobile nav
- `cv-placeholder.txt` — placeholder note for CV

How to add these files to your repository (recommended)
1. Create a new branch (locally or on GitHub) called `site`.
2. Add the files to the repository root.
3. Commit and push the `site` branch.
4. Open a Pull Request from `site` into `main`.

git checkout -b site
# copy files into repo root
git add index.html styles.css script.js README.md .gitignore cv-placeholder.txt
git commit -m "Add static personal website for Vishal Chauhan"
git push -u origin site
```
